Think of an activity in your life that you enjoy, but is not classically considered useful; desireable activities such as eating icecream, playing videogames, or reading fictional novels. Now consider areas in your life that you want to improve on; productive activities like eating healthier, exercising, and learning about investing. This is rather annoying. How can we desire two conflicting activities?

Why do you _want_ to spend time doing desireable activities? Because they are fun! <sup>[see tautology](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tautology)</sup> But in what sense do you _want_ to do productive activities? Probably so you can spend more time doing desireable activities. You want to eat healthy so you can live longer and have more time to fulfill desires. You want to exercise so you can feel better in the future. You want to have more money so you can have more purchasing options. These are all investment problems, and only some investments are worth it. It makes sense that you don't spend all your time being productive if you never get to spend time enjoying the outputs of that productivity.

But now imagine if you could get all the benefits of productive activities while only doing your desireable ones. Wouldn't that be better? Wouldn't it be _a lot_ better if you got to do exactly what you wanted all the time, while reaping all the benefits of purely productive activities? Unfortunately, which activities are productive is a consequence of the laws of the universe, so we can't realistically change them to match our desireable activities. Can we change our desires to match productive activities then?

For animals with brains, natural selection does this constantly. It happens to be that this universe gets populated with entities that replicate themselves most frequently (Grass, Humans) and also populated by their byproducts (Oxygen, Buildings). In order to replicate, you need to obtain resources, but this is only an instrumental goal. Eating is how animals get that done. It's not a coincidence, then, that almost all animals like eating and replicating <sup>[Rated PG-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#MPAA_film_ratings)</sup>. As far as the universe is concerned, self replication is the bottom line for productivity, and our desires represent the historical 

The environment has changed dramatically since humans showed up, and our desires no longer match productive activities. Evolution is _really_ slow though, and when environments change, it can take it millenia to adjust the desires of an organism. But humans regularly develop techniques that modify our behavior thousands of times faster natural selection can. Mostly through cultural ones like making healty food taste better, or through other means like consuming caffiene to be more "productive".



 [Quiverfull movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiverfull). 

In the wild, with natural selection as the only force, and a limited supply of creatures to work with, disconnects like this can last millenia as the _solution_ is slowly converged on. There will be over 10 billion humans by the end of the century, and they will have many techniques for _improvement_. How long will this disconnect last? 



### What is "openness"?

Whatever task you're doing, finding all your options is an important step. [Alpha Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) has numerical parameters that dictate how it explores new moves. Sometimes it finds moves that are good and remembers them for later. Most of the time, the moves aren't helpful and it remembers to avoid them in the future. ([better explanation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9M2Ho9I9Qo)) How open a human is might be logically equivalent.

### Humans also need to learn their move set

There is a strange fraction of humanity that seems to invent their own move set regularly. Most of the time it fails, but sometimes it succeeds so dramatically, even with simple ideas, and the rest of us wonder why we didn't think of that.

### So what about first borns?


### Can you be too open?
[There is a risk here too](http://www.paulgraham.com/disc.html). You end up wasting your time on activities that don't work out. And if youre

I don't find most people very interesting.

### Superintelligence
A few humans with the right level of discovery can take over entire industries.
