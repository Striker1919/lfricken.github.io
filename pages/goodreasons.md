Everyone has hold  There are doping scandals in the world of _reasons_.


"quote from armstrong about why he had to dope to get ahead"


This this situation isn't specific to sports, it applies to [every world that was created by Moloch](article on which types of world moloch creates), such as the world of _beliefs_

1. There is a competition among (ideas/cyclists).
2. Some ideas try to use cheaty tactics to get ahead (bad reasoning/doping)
3. Even the best (ideas/cyclists) have no choice but to follow suit to maintain thier lead.
4. Everyone figures out they have been cheating the whole time.
5. People determine the (idea/cyclist) must not have actually been good
6. We have to retroactively determine who the best was, which is a lot harder to do.


If we pick the wrong cyclist as the best, the consequences are minor. Not so much for beliefs about how to run the world.

Consequences for society at large (mariage, religion, etc)
