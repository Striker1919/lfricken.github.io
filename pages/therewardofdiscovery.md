The Reward of Discovery
=============
Inspired by [The Risk of Discovery](http://www.paulgraham.com/disc.html) by Paul Graham

After reviewing his survey data [Scott Alexander finds that over 70% of his readers are first borns](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/08/fight-me-psychologists-birth-order-effects-exist-and-are-very-strong/). He then goes on to say that this might have to do with "intellectual curiosity" and "openness to experience", but wonders why this might be the case for eldest siblings, and also implies it's hard to assess/define.

But that does not mean it's not a real thing, it just suggests we don't have the right jargon to talk about it intelligently yet. (example of discovering big idea before math was invented)

### What is "openness"?

Whatever task you're doing, finding all your options is an important step. [Alpha Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) has numerical parameters that dictate how it explores new moves. Sometimes it finds moves that are good and remembers them for later. Most of the time, the moves aren't helpful and it remembers to avoid them in the future. ([better explanation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9M2Ho9I9Qo)) How open a human is might be logically equivalent.

### Humans also need to learn their move set

We coddle children to keep their exploration parameter high.

There is a strange fraction of humanity that seems to invent their own move set regularly. Most of the time it fails, but sometimes it succeeds so dramatically, even with simple ideas, and the rest of us wonder why we didn't think of that.

### So what about first borns?


### Can you be too open?
[There is a risk here too](http://www.paulgraham.com/disc.html). You end up wasting your time on activities that don't work out. And if youre

I don't find most people very interesting.

### Superintelligence
A few humans with the right level of discovery can take over entire industries.
