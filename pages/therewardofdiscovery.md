The Reward of Discovery
=============


After reviewing his survey data [Scott Alexander finds that over 70% of his readers are first borns](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/08/fight-me-psychologists-birth-order-effects-exist-and-are-very-strong/). He then goes on to say that this might have to do with "intellectual curiosity" and "openness to experience", but wonders why this might be the case for eldest siblings, and also implies it's hard to assess/define.

But that does not mean it's not totally a real thing. It just suggests we don't have the right jargon to talk about it intelligently yet.

##What is "openness"?

Whatever task you're doing, finding all your options is an important step. [Alpha Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) has numerical parameters that dictate how it explores new moves. Sometimes it finds moves that are good and remembers them for later. Most of the time, the moves aren't helpful and it remembers to avoid them in the future. ([better explanation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9M2Ho9I9Qo)) How exploratory a human is might be logically equivalent.

Because it is so simple compared to a human brain, just a few numbers can be used to define how "open" Alpha Go is. With a human brain being so much more complex, it should be obvious that we don't see easy correlations between actions and openness to experience, for the simple fact that we don't have the tools to view the brain at the same level of detail as the mathematical parameters of Alpha Go. Even imagine trying to guess the mathematical parameters for different versions of Alpha Go based on their moves, with the added complexity that all the parameters can vary slightly between the versions, and they have trained on different data sets.

##Humans also need to learn their move set

There is a strange fraction of humanity that seems to invent their own move set regularly. Most of the time it fails catastrophically, but sometimes it is a shocking

##So what about first borns?


##Can you be too open?
[There is a risk here too](http://www.paulgraham.com/disc.html). You end up wasting your time on activities that don't work out. And if youre

I don't find most people very interesting.
