Goals and Values
=============

### Goals
1. Do you want money? If I gave you a button that would send you and every human to ever exist, present and future, to money heaven, with the stipulation that there wouldn't be anything to spend it on, nothing to make you happy, just you and everyone else with infinite dollar bills growing from trees for the rest of eternity, would you press it?
2. Do you want to be happy? If I gave you a button that would send you and every human to ever exist, present and future, to classical heaven, with the stipulation that there wouldn't be anything else there, no money or resources, just you and everyone else in infinite happiness for the rest of eternity, would you press it?

It's obvious that the only reason you want money is for its utility in doing other things like being happy. Presumably you won't use the money to make yourself unhappy, _intentionally at least_. But why then do you want to be happy? This seems harder to think about. We want money to achieve something else, but it doesn't seem like we want to be happy to achieve something else. It seems like a goal that has no further goals. A _Terminal Goal_. Obtaining money, on the other hand, was just a means to achieve that Terminal Goal. The moment money cannot help achieve the Terminal Goal, we _should_ stop caring about it. Money in this case is an _Instrumental Goal_.

We can think about other Instrumental Goals, like obtaining a job, which many people do only in order to get money. If we keep going, we can see that there were even more instrumental goals in this chain. We study for tests, so we can get good grades, so we can get a good job, so we can make money, so we can be happy. But there are usually many more instrumental goals as we start to break higher level goals and move down the chain of goals, and it starts to look like a [tree structure](need_image).


Yet this model doesn't capture human thinking or behavior very well. What's missing is


evolution and desires
Interactions between goals can start to grow complex.


### Conflict
Sometimes there are multiple paths to achieving a terminal goal.
These goals can start to conflict. Wouldn't it be better if we could align them []()?

Sam Harris has a similar set of ideas, unfortunately he is confused about a few minor details.

It is possible to choose poor instrumental goals.

Is it possible to choose the wrong terminal goal? 

### Is vs Ought
Terminal goals and instrumental goals are just another way of describing the is-ought distinction. Your terminal goals
